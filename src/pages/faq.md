    questions:
      - question: How long does shipping take?
        answer: >-
          Now that’s a frequent one all right, ain’t it? Your answer to this
          should *manage customer expectations*. Just like [a good checkout
          flow](http://bit.ly/2YCN3iG) should. Tell them the truth:

            - Bangalore shipping will take between 3 to 5 business days.
            - International shipping will take between 5 and 10 business days.
            - Mars shipping will be automatically redirected to Elon Musk’s Twitter account.
      - question: How do refunds and returns work?
        answer: >-
          It happens. Even the most beautiful of plants will disappoint
          *someone*. Again, tell it like it is:

            - All discounted items sales are final.
            - If you’d like another version of your item, please use the return label. Instructions are printed on its back.
            - If your item is damaged or not functioning correctly, email us at info@ekayu.com, and we’ll refund you + send you a new one ASAP!
      - question: How do you handle sensitive customer information?

          am I right? Make sure you’re as transparent as possible with your data
          handling process.
